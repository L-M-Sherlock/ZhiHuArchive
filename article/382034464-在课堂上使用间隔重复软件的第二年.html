在课堂上使用间隔重复软件的第二年

Here, I will talk about my successes and failures using Spaced Repetition Software (SRS) in the classroom for a second year. The year's not over yet, but I have reasons for reporting early that should become clear in a subsequent post. A third post will then follow, and together these will constitute a small sequence exploring classroom SRS and the adjacent ideas that bubble up when I think deeply about teaching.</p><p data-pid="UK7_iH6y">这是对<a href="http://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//www.lesswrong.com/lw/mfm/a_year_of_spaced_repetition_software_in_the/" class=" wrap external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">去年的报告</a>的跟进。在这里，我将谈一谈我第二年在课堂上使用间隔重复软件（SRS）的成功和失败之处。这一年还没有结束，但我有理由提前报告，这在随后的文章中应该会变得很清楚。第三篇文章将随后发表，这些文章将构成一个探索课堂 SRS 的小系列，以及当我深入思考教学问题时涌现的相关想法。</p><h2>Summary</h2><h2>摘要</h2><p data-pid="hmj0K-Dx">I experienced net negative progress this year in my efforts to improve classroom instruction via spaced repetition software. While this is mostly attributable to shifts in my personal priorities, I have also identified a number of additional failure modes for classroom SRS, as well as additional shortcomings of Anki for this use case. My experiences also showcase some fundamental challenges to teaching-in-general that SRS depressingly spotlights without being any less susceptible to. Regardless, I am more bullish than ever about the <i>potential</i> for classroom SRS, and will lay out a detailed vision for what it can be in the next post.</p><p data-pid="gXaj92k4">今年，我在通过间隔重复软件改进课堂教学的努力中经历了净负面的进展。虽然这主要是由于我个人优先事项的转变，但我也发现了课堂 SRS 的一些额外的失败模式，以及 Anki 在这些用例中的额外缺点。我的经验也展示了一般教学中的一些基本挑战，SRS 令人沮丧地指出了这些挑战，但却不容易受到影响。无论如何，我比以往任何时候都更看好课堂 SRS 的<i>潜力</i>，并将在下一篇文章中对它的前景做出详细描述。</p><h3>Prologue</h3><h3>序言</h3><p data-pid="SNrEIIiz">You might want to at least skim last year's <a href="http://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//www.lesswrong.com/lw/mfm/a_year_of_spaced_repetition_software_in_the/" class=" wrap external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">report</a>, even if you've read it before. My job description is unchanged, and my core approach to SRS stayed the same.

If gazing into my navel really isn't your thing, just skip the next section.</p><p data-pid="CoGV_yj5">此外，你可能会发现这份报告的大部分内容令人失望，原因与 SRS 本身无关，而与我有关——现在我将邀请你通过哲学的内省来理解这些原因。如果你真的不喜欢我的钻牛角尖，那就跳过下一节。</p><h3>Autopilot years</h3><h3>自动驾驶数年</h3><p data-pid="OFGaBeX3">The commonly appreciated upside of being a public schoolteacher in the United States is having more days off and greater job security than most workers.

On top of some smaller tweaks, I usually pick one big project every year that will add a new layer of awesome to what I do. One year, it was better writing mini-lessons and example content to go with them. Another, it was visual vocab slides with real-world example sentences. Twice, it was improved systems for grading and classroom management, facilitated by my hobbyist programming skills.</p><p data-pid="Fy6e9I3y">我已经做了这些事情中的大部分，但我个人的偏好是通过改进我的内容和工具，对我的核心课堂课程进行再投资。除了一些小的调整之外，我通常每年都会选择一个大项目，为我的工作增添一层新的精彩。有一年的项目是更好地编写迷你课程和与之配套的示例内容。另一个项目是带有真实世界例句的视觉词汇幻灯片。有两次，是通过我业余的编程技能，改进了成绩和课堂管理的系统。</p><p data-pid="_Olv8UOU">Not all such projects are successful. My first management system, for example, was an unworkable mess, necessitating the System 2.0 I brought on line the year after and have used ever since.

A good teacher on autopilot is better for your kid than the flailing rookie who takes their place when they switch careers. Sure, there are bad teachers on autopilot, but you should prefer they stay that way; the only thing worse than a bad teacher on autopilot is a bad teacher who is <i>not</i> detached, and actively imposes on the self-motivated students who might have otherwise learned something on their own.<sup data-text="Is a student able to read for fun during your class, dear teacher?

I didn't even reduce the <i>number</i> of cards!</p><p data-pid="j33IlHbn">所以，有很多我在去年的 SRS 目标列表中设定的事情，我没有做。我没有重新制作很多卡片。我没有采取更少的线性和更多的机会主义方法来引入新内容。我甚至没有减少卡片的<i>数量</i>！</p><p data-pid="akt2ZI26">Because, in the end, these tweaks began to feel far too small, like cobblestones on a path terminating in a local maxima where I'm doing “pretty cool” things in my classroom that no one else will replicate.

In other words, it's utterly unsharable. I could write a friendlier version, but it would be a pretty epic project that hardly anyone would actually use, simply because of different teaching styles. If I'm going to build a system to share, it's going to be System 3... the future system now haunting my dreams. 我为收集、计算和交流大量课堂指标而建立的“第二个系统”已经成为我的外围大脑。这是老师和管理人员真正来找我的原因。它也完全是由一个只考虑自己的人用粗糙的 excel vba 制作的；一个在函数级硬编码几乎所有内容的人，其输入验证的想法是“我永远不会那样发送”；他们的无障碍性概念是支持左手德沃夏克的无文档热键。换句话说，这是完全不可改变的。我可以写一个更友好的版本，但这将是一个相当史诗般的项目，几乎没有人会真正使用，只是因为不同的教学风格。如果我要建立一个共享的系统，那就是系统 3。。。未来的系统现在萦绕在我的梦里。" data-url="" data-draft-node="inline" data-draft-type="reference" data-numero="3">[3]</sup></p><p data-pid="ICuc_5Aa">因为，到最后，我开始觉得这些调整太小了，就像一条小路上的鹅卵石，终止于一个局部的最高点，在那里我在教室里做着其他人不会复制的“非常酷”的事情。我以前也走过这条路，但我现在没有这个心情。</p><p data-pid="47mANxj5">It's time to go big or go elsewhere, and upgrading <i>myself</i> has felt like the only way to make that happen.

Being a brand new test, the reports were sparser than I was used to. There was no “value-added” analysis to show me whether expectations were beat for my particular students (an area I have historically done well in), only a broad comparison to the students of other teachers in my department. My classes' average was only marginally higher than that of our most similar peer classes—a difference I would put handily within the margin of error, as we often seen very uneven distributions of talent between classes.

Certainly, the student experience is improved without harming test outcomes. I'm the English teacher students beg to have again (and occasionally manipulate the system into getting).

But even when I wasn't worried about time constraints, I still found it very difficult to press that red button. I think this was mostly self-consciousness. Pressing that button means putting the card back in an initial learning mode where, unless you cut the session short, it will come up multiple times again that day. This is by design, of course. But at the front of a classroom, it <i>feels</i> wrong. I blame two factors:</p><p data-pid="O2H7HGry">我明确的目标是重置一张卡片，因为很明显我们已经失去了对它的控制。但即使我不担心时间的限制，我还是发现很难按下那个红色按钮。我认为这主要是自我意识。按下该按钮意味着将卡片放回初始学习模式，除非你缩短课程，否则当天它会出现多次。当然，这是经过设计的。但在教室前面，感觉是不对的。我归咎于两个因素：</p><ol><li data-pid="CBSP6C3_">“Vivid memory, card ready” means we get most new cards right on the first try, so a repeated card feels broken by comparison.</li></ol><p data-pid="n_6N2WsJ">1）“生动记忆，卡片就绪”意味着我们在第一次尝试时就获得了大多数新卡片，因此一张重复的卡片在比较中感觉很糟糕。</p><ol><li data-pid="ue_We9iJ">I feel like I'm playing the part of an 18th century schoolmaster leading a class in chants at ruler-point. “Drill and kill” is a catchy phrase today's teachers hear in their heads whenever they use rote learning, because we've been heavily conditioned via our training and Hollywood that this is what Bad Teaching looks like.</li></ol><p data-pid="6U085a05">2）我感觉自己就像在扮演 18 世纪的校长，在统治地位带领全班同学诵读。"操练和杀戮 "是今天的教师每当使用死记硬背的方法时脑子里听到的一句话，因为我们已经通过培训和好莱坞受到了严重的制约，认为这就是不良教学的样子。</p><p data-pid="zIk9itrp">This might be one of the greatest overcorrections in the history of education. I'm not saying we should use unadorned repetition as our tool of first resort, but learning and remembering do not happen without some sort of reiteration going on, and we've made it taboo to use the most direct approach to it.

Some of my mediocre repeats seemed much more confident, but I'm used to seeing that with second-years even without SRS. Anki gave them a way to demonstrate their retention, though, as some of my boilerplate cards are the same for both of my grade levels.

If I didn't already believe the research about the mostly fixed-at-birth nature of intelligence, these seemingly leaky brains would certainly have pushed me in that direction.
